4. Replace `<password>` with your database password

#### Step 3: Update Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory:
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/construction_mgmt?retryWrites=true&w=majority
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key
PORT=4000
UPLOAD_DIR=uploads
MAX_FILE_SIZE=10485760
```

## üîß Running the Full Application
